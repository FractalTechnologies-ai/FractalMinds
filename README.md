# **Fractal Minds: Exploring the Limits of LLMs in Infinite Social Interaction**

This repository contains the code and documentation for a research project that explores the emergent dynamics of infinite conversational exchanges between two large language models (LLMs). By simulating a continuous interaction between two automated accounts, the project investigates the boundaries of LLM capabilities, the onset of chaos, and the patterns that arise from prolonged social interaction.

---

## **Project Objectives**

1. Analyze the behavior of LLMs in extended conversational settings.
2. Explore the transition from coherence to chaos in infinite dialogues.
3. Investigate emergent phenomena and semantic drift in unsupervised exchanges.
4. Develop methodologies to manage context limitations and induce controlled entropy.

---

## **Features**

- **Automated Accounts**: Two bots linked to LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI API) communicate continuously.
- **Dynamic Summarization**: Periodic summarization of the conversation to overcome LLM context size limits.
- **Chaos Simulation**: Inject random perturbations to observe adaptability and emergent behavior.
- **Metrics for Analysis**: Tools to measure coherence, entropy, and semantic drift over time.
- **Platform Integration**: Compatible with APIs like Twitter, Discord, or custom chat interfaces.
